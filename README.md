>This goal of this project is to model data on user activity of a music streaming app, Sparkify in a NoSQL database 
- Apache Cassandra - for testing query performance.

## General info
The project's main aim is to help the analysis team test the query performance for data modeled from a CSV file on
the music streaming app. The analyis team is interesting in understanding what songs users are listening to. An ETL
pipeline is created to transfer data stored in a directory of CSV files `event-datafile-new.csv` to an Apache Cassandra 
database.

## Project Setup
The project is divided into two main parts: Part I involves the development of the ETL pipeline for pre-processing files prior to creating 
data modeling. Part II involves creating tables on Apache Cassandra to load the processed data unto for quering. We shall look at both in detail.

### 1. Part I: ETL pipeline for pre-processing of files

### 2. Part II: Create tables on Apache Cassandra and load processed data unto tables
